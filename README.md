## Introduction

Are you tired of hitting refresh on the chocolate shop's website like a caffeinated squirrel? 🐿️ Only to find that the Fix Chocolate you desire has pulled a Houdini? 🪄 Fear not, chocolate crusader! This project automates the reservation process faster than you can say, “Where's the chocolate?” 🍬

With **Selenium**, this script navigates the website and snags those delectable bars before anyone else even gets a chance to blink! 👀

## How It Works
